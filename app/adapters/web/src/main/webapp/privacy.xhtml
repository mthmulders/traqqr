          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>
              Traqqr is a personal pet project of <a href="https://maarten.mulders.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maarten Mulders</a>, "I" or "me".
              This privacy policy explains how I use the personal data I collect from you when you use this website.
              It is based on a <a href="https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">template</a> provided by Proton Technologies AG.
          </p>
          <h2>What data do I collect?</h2>
          <p>
              I collect the following <strong>personal identification information</strong>:
          </p>

          <dl>
              <dt>Google user identifier</dt>
              <dd>
                  A alphanumerical value that identifies you, unique among all Google accounts and never reused.
                  Your Google account can have multiple email addresses at different points in time, but this value never changes.
                  This allows Traqqr to recognise you every time you log in.
              </dd>

              <dt>Given Name, Family Name, Display Name</dt>
              <dd>
                  The name you have supplied to Google.
                  This allows Traqqr to give you a personalised experience.
              </dd>

              <dt>Picture URL</dt>
              <dd>
                  A reference to your Google profile picture.
                  This allows Traqqr to give you a personalised experience.
              </dd>
          </dl>
