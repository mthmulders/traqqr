== Introduction and Goals

https://mthmulders.github.io/traqqr/[Traqqr] is a project for

* letting me keep track of the energy usage of my electric car
* evaluating and learning certain technologies:
** https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE]
** https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/[Jakarta Server Faces]

=== Requirements Overview
From a functional point of view, Traqqr is a web application for keeping track of the energy usage of an electric car.
The app that comes with my car does not provide such insights.

From a project perspective, I use Traqqr to study and evaluate technology, patterns and frameworks.
The functional requirements aren't too complex, leaving me enough room for attention to quality goals.

.Main features
* Logging in with a Google account.
* Register a car for measuring.
** This will issue an API key uniquely linked to that car.
** Re-issue an API key for an existing car.
* Register current battery capacity and mileage using a REST API.
* Link two of such measurements to define a trip.
* Combine two or more trips into a multi-leg trip.
* View energy usage for any trip.

| The display should look good enough.

| QC03
| Testability
| The architecture should allow easy testing of all main building blocks.
