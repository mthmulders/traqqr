|  | Constraint | Background and / or motivation

3+e| Software and programming constraints
| TC01
| Use of Java
| One of the <<section-introduction-and-goals, goals>> is to learn and evaluate certain technologies.
I don't want to learn too much new things at the same, so I stick to Java as the programming language.

| TC02
| Use of open source technology
| Third-party (not written by me) software must be available under an open-source license. It should not be necessary to download or purchase proprietary software in order to study or contribute to this project.

3+e| Operating System Constraints

| TC03
| OS independent
| Developing and running the project should not require any particular operating system. It should be possible on at least Windows, Linux and macOS.

|  | Constraint | Background and / or motivation

| OC1
| Team
| Primarily myself, Maarten Mulders. Contributions from others are welcome, but I don't expect too many.

| OC2
| IDE independent setup
| Developing and running the project should not require any particular IDE or editor. The project must be compilable on the command line via standard build tools (e.g., https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven]).

| OC3
| Configuration and version control / management
| Code is stored in a public Git repository with a complete commit history. This repository will host the code as well as this documentation.

| OC4
| Testing
| Use JUnit to prove functional correctness using unit tests and optionally integration tests. Use JaCoCo to ensure a high test coverage and use PiTest to ensure high quality of tests. Use https://playwright.dev/java[Playwright] to write functional integration tests. Use https://pitest.org/[Pitest] and the https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/[Stryker Dashboard] to run resp. display mutation testing (results).

| OC5
| Published under an Open Source license
| The source code as well as the documentation should be published under an Open Source license.

.Conventions

| | Convention | Background and / or motivation

| C1
| Architecture documentation
| Structure based on the (English) Arc42 template.

| C2
| Coding conventions
| The project uses the https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format[Palantir Java format]. Formatting is enforced through and can be executed using https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven[Spotless].

| C3
| Natural language
| English. The project and the documentation both target an international audience.
